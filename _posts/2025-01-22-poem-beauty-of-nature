*The Beauty of Nature* 

Beneath the vast and endless skies,  
A symphony of life softly lies.  
The whisper of the breeze, so pure,  
In natureâ€™s arms, the heart finds cure.  

The golden sun on morning dew,  
Each droplet shines, a world anew.  
A canvas painted green and gold,  
Where stories of the earth unfold.  

The forests hum with ancient songs,  
The rivers dance where they belong.  
The mountains stand in quiet grace,  
Guardians of this sacred place.  

The flowers bloom in colors bright,  
A gentle burst of pure delight.  
Each petal tells of seasons past,  
A fleeting beauty, yet to last.  

The moonlight bathes the tranquil seas,  
A silver hymn among the trees.  
And stars, like scattered dreams, aglow,  
Illuminate the world below.  

Oh, nature, boundless, wild, and free,  
A timeless muse, eternity.  
In your embrace, we come alive,  
In your great beauty, we survive.
